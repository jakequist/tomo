# Tomo — Build Notes: Bugs & Improvement Backlog

Running log kept by the autonomous build (2026-07-17 overnight run). Two
sections: **Bugs** found while dogfooding the live CLI, and **Improvements**
beyond the spec worth doing once milestones are complete. Each entry gets a
status when addressed.

## Bugs

- **Storm cluster (M5 priority #1)** — found via unthrottled hot-file storm
  (~4.5k rewrites/3s, `printf > hot.txt` tight loop). Fixed during M3:
  (a) `join_reader` deadlocked shutdown when the reader was blocked in a
  blocking `read(stdin)` — fatal errors became zombie processes (gdb-proven);
  now join-only-if-finished. (b) per-event index/status fsync throttled to
  250ms. (c) rescans deferred until 500ms quiescence (a scan during queued
  applies fabricates "local edits" of stale disk). (d) receiver integrity
  mismatch downgraded from fatal to refuse+warn+rescan.
  (e) ROOT-CAUSE FIX: watcher-thread hashing raced the session's own applies,
  fabricating phantom local heads → spurious conflicts (1,440/storm). Sigs
  are now resolved on the session thread at dequeue time (WatchSignal::
  Pending) — storm now converges with 0 conflicts, 0 refused frames.
  REMAINING for M5: (1) apply executor pairs "this frame's bytes" with "the
  batch's Apply target"; under MVR conflicts the Apply target can be a
  different head — source apply bytes BY SIG (frame bytes if matching, else
  disk, else the history CAS — it has the chunks!) instead of refusing.
  Refusal+rescan is the current safe fallback and no longer triggers in
  storms. (2) Add a permanent unthrottled-storm stress scenario (tight-loop
  `>` rewrites, no pacing) asserting bounded convergence + zero conflicts.
  — ADDRESSED (post-M6): `scenarios/14_storm_stress.sh`. A 4 s unthrottled
  `printf 'v%d' > hot.txt` tight loop (~5k writes/storm, no pacing) asserts:
  status < 2 s during the storm, convergence (roots + byte-identical hot.txt)
  within 60 s of storm end, ZERO conflict rows on both sides, hot.txt coalesced
  to < 50 versions, db check green; phase 2 repeats the storm overlapping a
  20 MiB chunked transfer. Measured 3×+ green: ~4.3k–6k writes/storm, max
  status latency 9–17 ms, hot.txt coalesced to 1–4 versions, 0 conflicts.
  (3) **Apply-clobbers-unscanned-local-edit race** (scenario 07 agent):
  an incoming Apply overwrites a concurrent local edit the watcher hasn't
  delivered yet — silent loss, no conflict row. — ADDRESSED (M5 hardening):
  `Engine::is_expected_echo` + an apply guard in session `do_apply` (and
  chunked assembly completion). Before any Apply we snapshot disk and, via
  the pure `applyguard::decide`, compare it to the target, the engine's
  pre-absorb winner (`prior`), and the echo journal: disk==target → skip;
  disk==prior or an echo → apply; otherwise it is an unobserved local edit →
  we do NOT overwrite, and instead feed `Event::Local(disk_state)` so the
  local bytes win locally and ship, with the remote head preserved in history
  (recoverable via `tomo log`). Counterfactual repro: guard off → 4/8 race
  runs silently lost the local edit; guard on → 8/8 lossless. HONEST LIMIT:
  because the local edit is fed *after* the remote absorb it is stamped
  causally-after (LWW, local preference) rather than concurrent, so no
  conflict ROW is written — a true row would need the pre-absorb clock the
  session cannot reconstruct. Acceptable v0 semantics; nothing is lost.

- **SIGPIPE panic**: `tomo log | head` panics with "Broken pipe" once the
  reader closes (std println! behavior). Needs a global EPIPE-handling pass
  in the CLI (reset SIGPIPE to default or handle write errors). (M3
  integration agent, 2026-07-17.) — ADDRESSED (post-M6): `unsafe` is forbidden
  workspace-wide, so we cannot reset SIGPIPE via `libc::signal`. Instead every
  informational command (`log`/`restore --stdout`/`status`/`conflicts`/
  `db check`/`dev`) prints through a new `crate::out` helper (`outln!` +
  `out::bytes`) that catches `ErrorKind::BrokenPipe` on write/flush and exits 0
  quietly; any other write error is swallowed (a print path must never panic).
  The broken-pipe classification is a pure, unit-tested function
  (`out::guarded_write` over a fake failing writer). Verified: `tomo log hot.txt
  | head -1` prints one line, exits 0, empty stderr (was a panic + backtrace).
- **Stale `connected: true` after death** — FIXED at M4: signal-hook
  SIGTERM/SIGINT handler drains history, flushes index/status with
  connected:false, and reaps the serve child (which previously leaked as an
  orphan on every harness teardown). Status-file write throttling also means
  live counters can lag ~2s; scenarios now `settle_status` before any
  quiet-window snapshot. (Dogfood, 2026-07-17.)

## SSH-config semantics (2026-07-18, `ssh-config-semantics` branch)

Extended `~/.ssh/config` support from IdentityFile-only to full connection
resolution, motivated by a real Mac failure: `Host vm1` with `HostName`,
`StrictHostKeyChecking no`, `UserKnownHostsFile /dev/null`, `ProxyJump p1`, and a
custom `IdentityFile` — `tomo sync vm1 …` failed "host key not in known_hosts"
(and could not reach vm1 anyway, since it is only reachable via p1).

- **Parser (`tomo-transport/sshconfig.rs`)** — still a pure, exhaustively
  unit-tested parser (text in, structured data out; the only I/O is
  `SshConfig::load`, which expands `Include` against the filesystem). Now
  resolves `HostName`/`User`/`Port`, `IdentityFile`(+`IdentitiesOnly`),
  `StrictHostKeyChecking` (`ask`→`yes`), `UserKnownHostsFile`, `ProxyJump`
  (recursive, cycle-guarded, depth cap 8, `none` disables), and `Include`
  (glob, relative to `~/.ssh`, in place). First-obtained-wins; `IdentityFile`
  accumulates. Unknown keywords ignored but their names collected. `%h` token
  in `HostName` intentionally NOT substituted (literal only) — rare, documented.
- **Connection (`ssh.rs`)** — the target is resolved into a `ResolvedRoute`
  (jumps + target). Host-key policy is a pure, unit-tested decision function
  (`decide_host_key`: known/unknown/changed × yes/no/accept-new). `accept-new`
  records via russh `learn_known_hosts_path` into the first non-`/dev/null`
  known_hosts. ProxyJump chains with russh `channel_open_direct_tcpip` +
  `client::connect_stream` over the channel's `ChannelStream`; jump handles are
  held in the session/`RemoteGuard` so the tunnel stays open. Each hop
  authenticates with its own identities.
- **`TOMO_SSH_CONFIG`** env override added (transport reads it instead of
  `~/.ssh/config`) — makes scenario 16 hermetic and is generally useful.
- **Connect log line** now names the resolved endpoint, e.g. `connecting to vm1
  (10.0.0.71 via p1) over SSH`; host-key notes ("accepting unverified host
  key…", "recorded new host key…") surface through the reporter (the library
  never prints — notes flow up via `RemoteGuard::notes`).
- **Scenario 16 (`16_ssh_config.sh`)** — hermetic `TOMO_SSH_CONFIG` against
  self-SSH: (a) alias→HostName + custom IdentityFile + `StrictHostKeyChecking
  no` + `/dev/null` converges with no known_hosts; (b) ProxyJump localhost→
  localhost proves the direct-tcpip chain end-to-end vs real sshd; (c)
  `accept-new` records once then reuses silently. 3× green; the real
  `~/.ssh/known_hosts` is checksummed unchanged.
- **CLI wiring** — kept minimal and SSH-config-scoped: `crates/tomo/src/
  transport.rs` (`describe_route`, `Transport::notes`) and `session.rs` (the
  enriched connect line + printing host-key notes). Note the OpenSSH client's
  own `-J localhost localhost` "jumphost loop" heuristic does NOT apply to tomo
  (russh + our resolver guard config-alias cycles, not same-host forwards),
  so localhost→localhost jumping is a valid, tested path.

## Host-key algorithm negotiation (2026-07-18, `hostkey-algo-negotiation` branch)

Follow-up bug from the ssh_config work, root-caused with a live repro on this VM
against v0.1.2. SYMPTOM: `tomo sync vm1 …` → "host key for p1 is not in
known_hosts" though `ssh p1` works. ROOT CAUSE: a known_hosts entry whose key
TYPE differs from what russh negotiates is reported Unknown — russh uses its
static host-key-algorithm order (ed25519 first) and negotiates ed25519, but the
file only has, e.g., ECDSA. OpenSSH avoids this by reading known_hosts first and
ordering `HostKeyAlgorithms` so already-recorded types are preferred. Exact
repro: `ssh-keyscan -t ecdsa 127.0.0.1 > kh; UserKnownHostsFile=kh` → fails; the
same file with all types (plain or hashed) works.

FIX (mirrors OpenSSH):
- `known_key_algos(files, host, port) -> Vec<russh::keys::Algorithm>` — the key
  types recorded for `host:port` across the hop's known_hosts. **Reuses russh's
  own `known_hosts::known_host_keys_path` line parser** (handles plain,
  `[host]:port`, comma-separated, and hashed `|1|salt|hash` entries and yields
  the recorded `PublicKey`s) → **NO new deps and no bespoke parser needed**; the
  coordinator's suggested `hmac`+`sha1` additions were avoided because russh
  already exposes exactly this. An `ssh-rsa` entry expands to the full RSA family
  (`rsa-sha2-512`/`-256`/`ssh-rsa`) so any RSA negotiation still matches.
- `preferred_key_order(known)` — recorded types first, then russh's remaining
  DEFAULT order; the set is never shrunk (empty ⇒ untouched default).
- Per-hop `client::Config` (the config was previously shared across the
  ProxyJump chain — now built per hop) sets `preferred.key` to that order.
  `StrictHostKeyChecking no` hops skip the scan (no lookup happens anyway).
- For an ecdsa-only file the produced order is: `ecdsa-sha2-nistp256`,
  `ssh-ed25519`, `ecdsa-sha2-nistp384`, `ecdsa-sha2-nistp521`, `rsa-sha2-512`,
  `rsa-sha2-256`, `ssh-rsa`.
- Tests: 8 pure unit tests for `known_key_algos`/`preferred_key_order` (plain,
  hashed-HMAC, `[host]:port` incl. port-mismatch negative, multiple types,
  ssh-rsa expansion, no-match/missing-file empty, dedup, ordering); scenario 16
  sub-check (d) — ecdsa-only known_hosts under default strict checking connects
  and converges (the p1 repro). 3× green; full suite (16) + `TOMO_LINK_MODE=ssh
  --quick` green; fmt/clippy/test workspace clean. Verified the live repro fails
  on v0.1.2 and passes with the fix.

## Known-hosts OpenSSH parity (2026-07-19, `knownhosts-parity` branch)

Third ssh-config follow-up, root-caused with real `ssh -G` data from the user's
Mac for the failing hop p1: `hostname p1`, `port 25601`, `stricthostkeychecking
ask`, user known-hosts = `~/.ssh/known_hosts ~/.ssh/known_hosts2`, global =
`/etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts{,2}`. `ssh-keygen -F p1` showed only a PLAIN `p1`
entry, which does NOT match the `[p1]:25601` lookup key for a non-22 port; the
working `[p1]:25601` entry lived in one of the four default files Tomo never
read (we consulted exactly one, `~/.ssh/known_hosts`).

FIXES (all OpenSSH-parity):
- **Default known-hosts set.** No `UserKnownHostsFile` directive ⇒ user set is
  `~/.ssh/known_hosts` **and** `~/.ssh/known_hosts2`. The **global** set
  (`GlobalKnownHostsFile`, default `/etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts{,2}`) is **always
  appended for lookup** (both verification and the algorithm scan). Recording
  (accept-new) still targets only the first non-`/dev/null` **user** file.
  New `GlobalKnownHostsFile` directive parsed; `ResolvedEndpoint` now carries
  `known_hosts_files` (user, defaults applied) + `global_known_hosts_files`, with
  `lookup_known_hosts()` (user++global) and `record_target()` helpers. Per-hop
  `client::Config` and the handler use the full lookup set.
- **Error transparency.** `HostKeyUnknown` now names the exact lookup key
  (`[host]:port` when port != 22) and lists every file consulted. Verbatim:
  `host key for [p1]:25601 not found (checked ~/.ssh/known_hosts,
  ~/.ssh/known_hosts2, /etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts, /etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts2) —
  connect once with `ssh p1` to record it, then retry` (paths shown absolute at
  runtime). A live capture: `host key for 127.0.0.1 not found (checked
  …/empty_kh, …/empty_kh2, /dev/null, …/empty_global) — connect once with `ssh
  127.0.0.1` …`.
- **`tomo dev ssh-route <target>` (+`--json`)** — the `ssh -G` analogue: per hop
  prints role/alias/hostname/port/effective-user/identity-files/agent-skipped/
  StrictHostKeyChecking/user+global known-hosts/consulted-set and the ProxyJump
  chain. Pure resolution, no network; honors `TOMO_SSH_CONFIG`. Rendering split
  into pure `route_view`/`render_human` (unit-tested).
- **Port-form matching (verified).** russh's `check_known_hosts_path` /
  `known_host_keys_path` follow OpenSSH: a plain `host` entry matches ONLY port
  22; a `[host]:port` entry matches ONLY that port. Proven by unit tests at both
  the verification level (`check_known_hosts_path`) and the algorithm-scan level.
  This is exactly the p1 failure — a plain `p1` entry can never satisfy a
  `[p1]:25601` lookup.
- **No new deps** (still reusing russh's line parser from the previous fix).
- Tests: file-set assembly (defaults, global-always-appended, override, record
  target skipping `/dev/null`/global), port-form matching (verification + scan),
  ssh-route rendering (human + json). Scenario 16 grew (e) key only in the
  SECOND `UserKnownHostsFile` (multi-file lookup) and (f) key only in a
  `GlobalKnownHostsFile` file (global consulted, never written), plus an
  ssh-route smoke asserting the printed port/hostname/known-hosts; every
  hermetic host now pins `GlobalKnownHostsFile /dev/null`. 3× green; full suite
  (16) + `TOMO_LINK_MODE=ssh --quick` green; fmt/clippy/test clean.

## known_hosts port-less fallback (2026-07-19, `without-port-fallback` branch)

Final p1 fix, proven by the user's `ssh -v` ("found matching key w/out port").
OpenSSH, when the `[host]:port` lookup for a non-22 port finds nothing, FALLS
BACK to the plain port-less `host` form and accepts a match there (compat with
entries recorded before port-qualified `known_hosts` lines existed —
hostfile.c/check_host_key). The user's plain `p1` line is what authenticates
p1:25601; our strict port-form-only matching missed it.

FIX (OpenSSH parity, narrowly scoped):
- **Verification** (`lookup_host_key`, new wrapper over `aggregate_lookup`): for
  `port != 22`, when the `[host]:port` lookup across all files yields NotFound,
  retry the SAME files with the plain (port-22) form. Port-form
  Match/Changed/ReadError always take precedence; a plain-form Match →
  Match (+`without_port` flag → note); a plain-form Changed → Changed (full
  mismatch). Returns `(outcome, matched_without_port)`.
- **Algorithm scan** (`known_key_algos`): same fallback — port-form types first;
  if the non-22 lookup yields none, use the plain-form types.
- **Recording** UNCHANGED: accept-new still records the port-qualified form for
  non-22 ports (as OpenSSH does for new entries).
- **Note (verbatim):** `using known_hosts entry for 127.0.0.1 without a port
  (OpenSSH compat)` — emitted only on a plain-form match after a port-form miss.
- **Not-found error now names both forms (verbatim, live):** `host key for
  [127.0.0.1]:39023 (and 127.0.0.1 without port) not found (checked …/empty,
  /dev/null) — connect once with `ssh 127.0.0.1` to record it, then retry`.
- Tests: fallback match (+flag), plain-entry wrong-key → Mismatch, port-form
  precedence over conflicting plain, port-22 unaffected, neither-form → NotFound,
  algo-scan fallback; the old "plain entry absent for non-22" test was inverted
  to "found via fallback". Scenario 16 sub-check (g): a REAL alt-port sshd
  (`ensure_alt_sshd PORT` harness helper — `sudo /usr/sbin/sshd -p PORT -o
  PidFile=…`, pidfile cleanup, skips if sudo/sshd absent) with a known_hosts
  holding ONLY a plain 127.0.0.1 entry connects via the fallback and asserts the
  compat note. 3× green; full suite (16) + `TOMO_LINK_MODE=ssh --quick` green;
  fmt/clippy/test clean. No new deps.

## macOS↔Linux filename semantics (2026-07-19, `filename-semantics` branch)

Tier-1 edge case 3, built platform-generic on the Linux VM (which has neither
APFS behavior) with a runtime FS probe; the real-APFS validation is flagged for
the Mac session in `docs/HANDOFF-MACOS.md`. Two hazards of the flagship pairing
(macOS APFS: case-insensitive by default, returns NFD from `readdir` ↔ Linux:
case-sensitive, byte-preserving):

- **(a) Case collision.** Linux-distinct `Foo.txt`/`foo.txt` are the SAME file
  on case-insensitive APFS → a blind apply of the second silently overwrites the
  first, and the index/echo bookkeeping (still two `RelPath`s) thrashes.
- **(b) NFC/NFD ping-pong.** A Linux NFC name, written to APFS, is stored and
  `readdir`'d back as NFD → the Mac scan sees a DIFFERENT `RelPath` than the
  Linux original → endless duplicate-file create/delete.

FIX (lead's design):
- **FS probe at startup** (`crates/tomo/src/fsprobe.rs`, in `tomo`, NOT the
  engine). Creates probe files under `.tomo/state/` and observes them →
  `FsSemantics { case_insensitive, normalizes_unicode }`. Case: create
  `…CaseA`, check a `…casea` lookup. Normalization: write an NFC name, `readdir`,
  see whether the exact bytes return (byte-preserving) or only an NFC-equal
  variant (normalizing). Pure interpreters (`interpret_case`/`interpret_norm`)
  unit-tested; the I/O shim degrades to the safe byte-preserving/case-sensitive
  default on any error. Result recorded additively in `status.json` as `fs`.
  Debug hook `TOMO_TEST_FORCE_FS` (cfg(debug_assertions), mirrors the other
  `TOMO_TEST_FORCE_*`) forces the result for scenario testing on Linux.
- **NFC canonicalization on local-FS ingress** (`crates/tomo-watch/src/norm.rs`;
  new `unicode-normalization` workspace dep + SPEC §11 row). Applied in the
  watcher's and scanner's `relativize` (a `normalize_unicode` flag threaded
  through `Canonicalizer::new`, `Watcher::start`, `scan_diff`) — ONLY when the FS
  itself normalizes, so a Linux user's genuinely-NFD names are preserved
  byte-for-byte. Wire/engine stay byte-faithful. This makes an APFS-NFD readdir
  name and the Linux NFC original the SAME `RelPath` → ping-pong impossible.
- **Case-collision ingress guard** (`crates/tomo/src/fsguard.rs` pure detector +
  `Session::case_collision_refused`). On a case-insensitive FS, an inbound
  `Modified` apply for `P` where a DIFFERENT present index path `Q` satisfies
  `casefold(P)==casefold(Q)` (fold = Rust `str::to_lowercase`, Unicode simple
  lowercase) is REFUSED: `Q` is kept, the incoming bytes (frame or CAS) are
  preserved to history under `P` (recoverable via `tomo log P`, idempotent on
  re-ship), a `⚠ case collision:` note is emitted, and the path is counted as a
  conflict. First-writer-wins, never blocks sync (invariant #5). Guarded on both
  the inline `Change` and the large-file assembly-completion paths. Inert on a
  case-sensitive FS.
- **Scenario 20 (`20_filename_semantics.sh`)**: phase A/B — NFC/NFD pair and
  Foo/foo pair both sync as DISTINCT files Linux↔Linux (asserts NO
  over-normalization on a byte-preserving FS; `.fs` in status is
  case-sensitive+byte-preserving) and converge with 0 conflicts; phase C —
  `TOMO_TEST_FORCE_FS=case-insensitive` on B, A ships `Foo.txt` then a
  different-bytes `foo.txt`, B keeps the first, refuses+preserves the second with
  the note, counts a conflict, stays connected, and A is unaffected; the control
  file still round-trips. 3× green; full suite green; fmt/clippy/test clean.
  HONEST LIMIT: the Linux VM can only test *name derivation* to NFC
  (`relativize` unit test) — the "NFC `RelPath` also reads back the NFD file"
  round-trip and every real case/normalization detection is a Mac-session item.

### APFS validation on real hardware (2026-07-19, `apfs-validation` branch, Mac/Apple silicon, Darwin 25)

Ran the HANDOFF-MACOS checklist on real APFS. **Headline finding: the design's
core assumption about APFS Unicode behavior is outdated.** Modern APFS (10.13+,
this Mac is Darwin 25) is normalization-**preserving** and normalization-
**insensitive** — it is NOT the NFD-normalizing HFS+ the machinery was written
for. Proven at the FS level (Python: create NFC `café.txt` → `readdir` returns
the exact NFC bytes; a second `open(NFD, "x")` fails `FileExistsError`; NFD
lookup opens the NFC file; `Foo.txt`/`foo.txt` collide).

- **Item 1 — probe (VALIDATED, with a finding).** Default APFS →
  `{"case_insensitive":true,"normalizes_unicode":false}`; a case-sensitive APFS
  volume (`hdiutil create -fs 'Case-sensitive APFS'`) → `case_insensitive:false`.
  Zero `.tomo-fsprobe-*` residue. The case probe is correct. **`normalizes_unicode`
  is `false`, not the `true` the handoff expected** — and `false` is the HONEST
  reading: `probe_norm` measures "does the FS change my bytes on store", and
  modern APFS does not (it preserves). The handoff/`filename-semantics` write-up
  assumed APFS "stores and readdir's back as NFD" (HFS+ behavior); that is wrong
  for modern APFS. Corrected the misleading comment in `probe_norm`.
- **Items 2 & 5 — single-name NFC round-trip (VALIDATED).** An NFC `café.txt`
  created in a Tomo project on APFS syncs to a peer with the **byte-identical NFC
  name**, content intact, roots converged, no ping-pong — *without* the NFC
  canonicalization ever firing (it is gated on `normalizes_unicode`, which is
  false). So on modern APFS the common case is fine precisely because APFS
  preserves. Hazard (b) as designed ("NFC stored as NFD → ping-pong") does not
  occur here.
- **Item 4 — case-collision guard (VALIDATED).** A on default APFS, B on a
  case-sensitive APFS volume holding `Foo.txt`+`foo.txt` (distinct bytes): A
  keeps `Foo.txt`, refuses `foo.txt` (no silent overwrite), logs `⚠ case
  collision`, stays connected, and the refused bytes recover via `tomo log
  foo.txt` (1 version). NUANCE: `conflicts_unresolved` read `0` though the design
  says the collision "counts a conflict" — the safety behavior is correct
  (nothing lost, no overwrite); the counter surfacing wants a second look
  (possibly recorded as resolved, or a different field).
- **Item 3 — NFC/NFD collision (VALIDATED end-to-end; handled SAFELY).** Ran the
  real test against `vm8` (Linux ext4, normalization-sensitive): it held both
  `café`-NFC ("NFC-content") and `café`-NFD ("NFD-content") as distinct files and
  shipped both to the Mac, where they are the SAME file (APFS insensitive). The
  Mac's outcome: ONE file on disk (NFC name, second-writer's content), **a
  conflict recorded** (`café.txt`, winner/loser), **both contents preserved in
  history** (`tomo log` recovers NFC-content AND NFD-content — no data loss),
  **no ping-pong** (frame counter flat over 12s), db check green BOTH sides,
  stays connected. Mac has 1 file / vm8 has 2 — physically unavoidable (APFS
  cannot hold both forms), so identical trees are impossible for this input; the
  best achievable outcome (no loss, no churn, conflict surfaced, integrity green)
  is exactly what happens. **This corrects an earlier prediction in this file
  that the collision was an "unguarded silent-overwrite hazard" — it is NOT.**
  The general MVR conflict-resolution/apply path catches it (invariant #5), even
  though the dedicated `fsguard` case-guard does not fire (it folds case only, so
  there is no `⚠ case collision` note for the normalization case — only a generic
  conflict row). Safety is intact; the only gap is cosmetic/UX.
  - **Optional polish (NOT a safety fix):** make the probe detect normalization-
    **insensitivity** (create NFC, look up NFD — does it resolve?) and gate
    NFC-canonicalization on that. Canonicalizing every `RelPath` to NFC when the
    FS is insensitive would collapse both forms to ONE path → a plain
    last-writer-wins same-file update instead of a two-`RelPath` conflict, and a
    clearer story than the current generic conflict. Nice-to-have consistency,
    not a correctness fix, and it changes the `filename-semantics` machinery, so
    it warrants a decision / coordination with the Linux side.

- **Connectivity to `vm8` — Tailscale, NOT Local Network Privacy (earlier
  misdiagnosis, corrected).** The VMs are on Tailscale; `vm8` MagicDNS resolves
  to its Tailscale IP `100.108.4.128`, and direct LAN `10.0.0.x` has firewall
  restrictions. tomo now honors `~/.ssh/config` `HostName` (added in the Linux
  side's SSH-config work), and the `Host vm8` block sets `HostName 10.0.0.78`, so
  `tomo connect jake@vm8` dialed the firewall-restricted LAN IP → `No route to
  host`. (I initially, wrongly, attributed this to macOS Local Network Privacy;
  the tell that disproved it: `python`/`ssh`/`nc` "reaching 10.0.0.78" were also
  the LAN path, and the real fix was routing.) **Working recipe:** connect tomo
  to the Tailscale IP directly, `jake@100.108.4.128`, which bypasses the config
  `HostName`; record its host key (`ssh-keyscan -H 100.108.4.128 >> known_hosts`);
  and supply the key vm8 accepts. Two real secondary findings surfaced:
  1. **`tomo connect --identity <path>` is not persisted** to `[remote]`: after
     `connect --force --identity ~/.ssh/id_m_machines …`, the written `[remote]`
     had `host`+`path` but NO `identity` line, and validation only tried
     ssh-agent + the global `id_tokyo` (the `Host vm8` block's `id_m_machines`
     did not apply because the target was an IP, not `vm8`). This looks like a
     regression from the SSH-config refactors (I added `--identity` + persistence
     on `darwin-support`); worth confirming and re-fixing. Workaround used:
     `ssh-agent` + `ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_m_machines`, which tomo's agent-auth then
     used to bootstrap+handshake fine (protocol v2).
  2. **ssh-config `HostName` vs Tailscale:** honoring `HostName` is correct
     OpenSSH parity, but it means a config alias whose `HostName` is a
     now-firewalled LAN IP can't reach a host that is only reachable via
     Tailscale/MagicDNS. Not a bug per se, but a real footgun for the
     laptop↔server case; a clearer error than a bare "No route to host" (naming
     the host/IP it tried) would help.

Concrete changes on this branch: fixed the `live_probe_on_linux_*` unit test
(now `live_probe_reports_byte_preserving_and_leaves_no_residue`, platform-aware —
Linux keeps case-sensitive+preserving; macOS asserts only the cross-platform
byte-preserving invariant since case depends on the volume) so the suite is green
on real APFS; corrected the outdated `probe_norm` comment. The
normalization-insensitivity fix and the Local Network permission are left for a
decision.

## Improvements

- **Editor temp-file churn**: rename-based saves briefly sync the temp file
  (e.g. `.main.rs.swp.123`) to the peer before its deletion propagates.
  Converges, but wasteful and will pollute history at M3. Consider default
  ignore patterns for common editor temps (`*.swp*`, `*~`, `.#*`, `4913`)
  and/or stateful rename pairing in the canonicalizer. (Found reviewing M1
  watch design, 2026-07-17.) — ADDRESSED (post-M6): `tomo-config` now ships
  BUILT-IN default ignore rules (`DEFAULT_IGNORE_PATTERNS`: `**/*.swp`,
  `**/*.swx`, `**/.*.sw?`, `**/*~`, `**/.#*`, `**/#*#`, `**/4913`) applied
  BEFORE user rules (earliest in the last-match-wins list, so any user rule for
  the same pattern overrides them). Toggle with `[sync] default_ignores`
  (default `true`); the `tomo init` template documents it. Editor temps now
  never cross the wire or enter history by default. (Stateful rename pairing is
  a separate, still-open refinement.)
- **Zero-byte truncate intermediates get versioned**: `>`-style saves under
  light load can record a truthful-but-noisy 0-byte version between real
  ones. Consider a tiny same-path capture-coalescing window (history only,
  never sync) or skipping empty captures that are immediately superseded.
  (Dogfood, M3.) — ADDRESSED (post-M6): the adaptive `PressureController`'s
  rung 0 is now floored to `min_capture_window_ms` (default 75 ms, in
  `PressureConfig`) instead of a hard 0 ms — adaptive mode ONLY. A lone save is
  still versioned (it flushes 75 ms later; invariant #4 intact), but a same-path
  truncate+write pair coalesces into the single final state, dropping the 0-byte
  intermediate. The live sync path is untouched (invariant #3); `every-change`
  stays literally 0 ms. Property tests (no-lost-final-write, monotonic, decay)
  still pass; example tests cover the truncate+write coalescing and lone-save
  cases. SPEC §6.2 updated (0→75 ms entry window).
- **`tomo connect` idempotence**: re-running connect with the IDENTICAL
  target should revalidate (useful health check) instead of erroring;
  a different target should require `--force`. (Dogfood, M2.) — ADDRESSED
  (post-M6): `tomo connect` now parses the recorded `[remote]` and (via the
  pure, unit-tested `decide_connect`) revalidates in place when host+path are
  identical, refuses a DIFFERENT target with a message pointing at `--force`,
  and on `--force` strips the old `[remote]` and rewrites it before
  revalidating. New `--force` flag; help text and `connect` docs updated.
- **russh crypto backend**: aws-lc-rs builds static-musl fine on this VM
  (cmake needed), but consider the `ring` backend at M6 for binary size and
  build simplicity; russh 0.54.5 also emits a future-incompat warning —
  check for a russh update then.
- **First-class directory tracking**: v0 syncs files only; empty-dir
  existence can differ between sides (SPEC §5.4). Needed eventually for the
  git ambition (empty dirs, dir renames, permissions). Post-M6.
- **Local control socket**: `tomo status` reads a status file written by the
  watch process (M1 design). A local socket (SPEC future "API protocol")
  would give live queries without file staleness. Post-M6.

## Environment / build-run journal

- 2026-07-17: `rustup target add x86_64-unknown-linux-musl` failed with a
  rustup download-cache error on first attempt; retry needed before M6.

### Real Mac→Linux cross-platform sync validated (2026-07-17, Mac↔vm8)

Exercised the whole cross-platform path against a REAL Linux server (`vm8`,
x86_64 Linux, over real SSH) from the Apple-silicon Mac:

- **Cross-compile toolchain on macOS:** `brew install zig` (0.16.0) +
  `cargo install cargo-zigbuild` (0.23.0) + `rustup target add
  x86_64-unknown-linux-musl`. `cargo zigbuild --release --target
  x86_64-unknown-linux-musl -p tomo` produced a **statically linked** ELF
  (9.0 MB, `file` says "statically linked, stripped"; `ldd` on vm8: "not a
  dynamic executable") that runs on vm8 (`tomo 0.0.1`). Zig handles the C deps
  (bundled SQLite, zstd, blake3) cleanly; one benign linker warning
  ("deprecated linker optimization setting '1'"). This is exactly what CI's
  thin-linux / fat jobs do — the pipeline works from macOS.
- **Fat darwin host binary:** `TOMO_EMBED_DIR=<dist> cargo build --release -p
  tomo --features embed-binaries` on the native arm64 host embeds the musl
  artifact (`tomo dev embedded-binaries --json` → x86_64-unknown-linux-musl,
  0.0.1, 9402024 bytes). Needed because Mac(aarch64-darwin)→Linux(x86_64-musl)
  differs in BOTH arch and OS, so the dev-mode `current_exe` substitution is
  (correctly) refused — real cross-platform needs the embedded artifact.
- **Bootstrap:** `tomo connect jake@vm8 /tmp/…` with the fat binary pushed the
  embedded musl binary over SFTP to `.tomo/bin/tomo-0.0.1-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl`,
  exec'd it, and handshook at protocol v1 — "[embedded static artifact]".
- **Two-way sync:** Mac→vm8 and vm8→Mac both propagate in <1s.
- **Conflict under partition (SIGSTOP the vm8 serve child):** concurrent edits
  on both sides, heal → both converge to the IDENTICAL winner, **1 conflict row**
  recorded, conflict.txt carries **3 versions** (base + both edits), the losing
  (Mac) bytes recover byte-exact via `restore --version --stdout`. `db check`
  green on BOTH sides (darwin + linux-musl). Everything cleaned up after
  (remote /tmp dir removed, watch stopped, 0 strays). Mission step 4 ✅.

### macOS bring-up (2026-07-17, `darwin-support` branch, real Mac mini / Apple silicon)

- **Rust code is fully portable — zero source changes to build/test.** Fresh
  `rustup` stable (aarch64-apple-darwin, 1.97.1) + Xcode CLT: `cargo build`,
  `cargo test --workspace` (all unit/integration/doctests), `cargo clippy
  --workspace --all-targets -D warnings`, and `cargo fmt --check` all pass
  untouched. russh=`ring`, rusqlite/zstd bundled via `cc` — no OpenSSL, no
  aws-lc, no glibc friction. FSEvents backend (`notify` 8.2) works out of the
  box; scenarios 02 (echo/new-dir race) and 03 (editor atomic saves) — the
  flagged FSEvents risk areas — pass, and `map_event`'s imprecise-`Any`→re-stat
  mapping holds. Coalesced small-file sprays do NOT spuriously trip the
  `dir_appeared`→`NeedsRescan` guard (probed directly: `reconciling` never flips
  under a 500-file spray).

- **The real macOS work was the bash harness, not the product.** Fixes on
  `darwin-support` (all keep Linux behavior identical):
  - *`date +%s%N` / `stat -c` are GNU-only.* Added portable shims to
    `scenarios/lib/harness.sh` (`now_ms`/`now_ns`, `stat_size`/`stat_mtime`/
    `stat_mtime_ns`/`stat_inode`) that prefer native GNU, then coreutils `g*`
    (Homebrew: `brew install coreutils`), then a BSD/`perl` fallback. Ported the
    17 harness call sites plus scenarios 04/05/06/09/11/14. macOS ships a native
    `/sbin/sha256sum`, so scenario 04's hash check needed no change.
  - *Storm generators were fork-throttled on macOS.* Scenarios 06 and 14 built
    their storms with a `$(date +%s)` (and, in 06, `sleep`) fork PER iteration;
    macOS fork is dear enough that the "storm" fell below the ≥1000-write bar
    (06: 604; 14: 868). Switched the deadline to the `SECONDS` builtin (no fork)
    and, in 06, batched the pacing `sleep` across 10 writes. Now 06 ≈ 5.7k
    writes, 14 ≈ 84k unthrottled writes — genuine storms on both platforms,
    still coalescing to 1–2 versions with 0 conflicts.
  - *Watch pids were never registered for cleanup.* `start_watch` is always
    called as `WATCH="$(start_watch …)"`, so its `register_pid` ran in the
    command-substitution subshell and never reached the parent's CLEANUP_PIDS —
    watches reparented to init and accumulated (a scenario-06 orphan was still
    running mid-session, skewing timing). Added a teardown safety sweep:
    `pkill -9 -f "$WORK"` (unique tmpdir → scenario-isolated). Latent on Linux
    too; the sweep fixes both.
  - *Self-SSH host-key staleness + Linux-only setup.* `ensure_self_ssh` now
    clears stale `localhost`/`127.0.0.1`/`::1` known_hosts entries before
    re-scanning (a rotated host key otherwise makes `ssh` refuse before auth),
    and gates the `apt-get`/`service` path to Linux; on Darwin it points at
    Remote Login rather than spawning a rogue `/usr/sbin/sshd`.

- **Scenario 12 (ignore flip) needed a bigger reconnect timeout, not a fix.**
  After the flip removes the `target/` ignore rule, A's startup scan re-hashes
  the whole ~200 MiB `target/` tree BEFORE reporting connected; the DEBUG build's
  -O0 BLAKE3 takes ~18s to do that on this host (the Linux dev VM squeaked under
  the old 15s). Bumped the post-flip `wait_for` to 60s with a comment. Same
  -O0-hashing class the header of scenario 11 already documents.

- **Scenario 11 (1 GiB + churn) — interleaving holds; the ABSOLUTE latency bound
  is host-relative.** Small-file latency under the concurrent 1 GiB transfer
  peaks ~11.2s on macOS/APFS (M-series, release build) and PLATEAUS the instant
  the bulk transfer completes — batches keep landing continuously throughout
  (early batches 2.3s/7s), the process stays responsive (max `status` 8ms), the
  1 GiB arrives byte-identical, db green. That is the head-of-line-blocking
  property (interleaved, never starved), just with a peak that tracks this host's
  1 GiB-ship time rather than the dev VM's. Made the default bound platform-aware
  (Linux 10s unchanged, Darwin 20s) with a comment; a true starvation regression
  (every batch delayed by the full transfer, latency never plateauing) still
  trips it. NOT a product regression.

- **Scenario 13 (clock skew) skips on macOS by design.** libfaketime relies on
  `DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES`, which SIP strips for system binaries — the offset
  never reaches tomo's children. Added a Darwin-aware `skip` with that reason;
  invariant #7 is exercised on Linux and the engine's vector-clock ordering is
  platform-independent pure logic.

- **RESOLVED — ssh-mode scenarios (01–04) now green; taught the transport to
  read `~/.ssh/config`.** The blocker: this Mac is a REAL machine (not the
  throwaway VM) — `~/.ssh` has real keys (`id_tokyo`, `id_github`, …), an
  `~/.ssh/config` (global `IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_tokyo`), and NO
  `id_ed25519`/`id_rsa`. System `ssh localhost` works (via `id_tokyo` from the
  config); but `tomo-transport` only tried ssh-agent (no `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` here)
  then the hardcoded `~/.ssh/{id_ed25519,id_rsa}` — it did NOT parse
  `~/.ssh/config`, so `tomo connect` failed "ssh-agent (no SSH_AUTH_SOCK)".
  Chose option (c), the real product fix (jake's call): a new pure `ssh_config`
  parser (`crates/tomo-transport/src/sshconfig.rs`, 13 unit tests: global +
  `Host` globs/`!`-negation, `IdentityFile` accumulation, `~`/`%d` expansion,
  quoting, dedup) resolves the `IdentityFile`s for the target host; the CLI
  (`SshParams::from_remote`) layers auth as agent → recorded `--identity` →
  `~/.ssh/config` keys → defaults, deduped. Also added `tomo connect --identity
  <path>` (persisted as `[remote] identity` so `tomo watch` reuses it;
  `tomo-config::Remote` gained the optional field). Verified by hand
  (`tomo connect jake@localhost` bootstraps + handshakes via `id_tokyo`) and by
  the ssh-mode suite: 01/02/03/04 all PASS under `TOMO_LINK_MODE=ssh`, and 04
  PASSes in the default run. SPEC §2 documents the auth order. Encrypted
  (passphrase) keys remain out of scope for v0.

## Edge-case investigation ledger (2026-07-19 review; Jake approved Tier 1+2)

Tier 1 (bugs / flagship breakers):
1. Nested `.tomo` synced by an outer project (sibling of the .git bug) —
   FOLDED INTO ux-nits batch (default rules + ingress guard).
2. Executable bit not synced: ContentSig is hash+size; applier writes default
   perms. Breaks artifact-flowback. Fix: carry exec bit in ContentSig
   (index/proto/history format change), preserve on apply. Old persisted
   index decode fails → empty + rescan churn once; document.
3. macOS↔Linux filename semantics: (a) case-insensitive APFS collapses
   Linux-distinct names; (b) NFC/NFD normalization ping-pong. Plan: FS
   case-probe at startup + collision refusal (conflict-style preserve),
   NFC normalization on ingest where FS returns NFD; Mac session validates.
   — ADDRESSED (filename-semantics branch, Linux-side; see the section below
   and docs/HANDOFF-MACOS.md "Filename semantics validation" for the real-APFS
   legs the Mac session must run).
4. Symlink write-escape: apply can write through a symlinked parent to
   outside the root. Canonicalize-parent-under-root check before rename.
   DONE (apply-hardening): `apply::check_parents` — per-component lstat walk
   refusing ANY symlink parent (in-root ones too; writes go through real dirs
   only, OpenSSH/rsync posture) plus a deepest-existing-ancestor canonicalize
   within root. Wired into `apply_present` + chunked completion (both route
   through `apply_present_by_sig`) and `apply_absent`'s delete/prune path.
   Non-fatal (`CliError::Refused` → note + rescan, invariant #5). A symlink AT
   the final path is fine (rename replaces the link, not its target).
5. File↔dir type replacement races: define semantics + scenario. DONE
   (apply-hardening): rule is **dir wins** — a directory with present synced
   descendants beats a colliding file; the file is preserved to history and its
   head converges to a tombstone. Total + deterministic (structural property of
   the index, no clock/replica input). See docs/SPEC.md §5.4 and scenario 19.
   Applier: `type_collision` (parent-is-file / target-is-dir) + `path_is_dir`
   (refuse dir deletion on a file-removal); session preserves bytes then clears
   the obstruction / keeps the directory, always non-fatally.

Tier 2: .DS_Store/Thumbs.db + sqlite -wal/-shm/-journal default ignores;
symlink-replaces-file = deletion (decide/document/test); live-db torn-copy
guidance; disk-full degradation scenario (tmpfs); overlapping-tree guard
(peer path inside local root); startup-scan mtime+size cache (perf at 100k
files); FIFO-in-tree scanner safety test; reject control chars in RelPath.

## Tier-2 batch (2026-07-19, `tier2-batch` branch)

- **Control chars in `RelPath` (edge 7).** `RelPath::new` now rejects any ASCII
  control byte `0x01`–`0x1F` (newline, tab, CR, …) as a new
  `PathError::ControlChar`; NUL still reports the more specific `PathError::NulByte`
  first. COMPAT STANCE: a filename bearing a raw control character was never sane
  to sync — it breaks line-based tooling, terminal rendering, and the wire's
  textual diagnostics — so such a name is dropped at construction, exactly like a
  `..` or NUL path. Both ingress paths already discard a `RelPath::new` failure
  silently (`canon::relativize` and `scan::relativize` use `RelPath::new(..).ok()`),
  so a peer or local FS bearing such a name simply never enters the index — no
  crash, no partial sync, no error surfaced. Unit tests: engine `rejects_control_characters`
  (newline/CR/tab/low-byte/trailing-newline, NUL-precedence, space unaffected)
  and watch `canon::drops_control_char_paths` (silent ingress drop).

- **Startup-scan mtime+size cache (edge 5).** New `tomo-watch::scancache`
  (`ScanCache` = path → `(mtime_ns, size, ContentSig)`, postcard, versioned header)
  + `scan_diff_cached(…, cache, now_ns)` returning the diff AND a rebuilt cache. A
  file whose `(mtime_ns, size)` still match the cache reuses its stored content
  hash **without reading/BLAKE3-ing the bytes** (rsync's quick-check); the fresh
  `lstat` still supplies size/exec, so a chmod-only change (bumps ctime, not
  mtime) is still detected. SAFETY: `decide` never trusts an mtime within 2 s of
  `now_ns` (a file may be mid-write) → always hashes; a stale entry (mtime moved)
  → hashes; a corrupt/old-version cache → discarded silently (`decode`→None) →
  full cold scan. Persisted at `.tomo/state/scancache.bin` (atomic write); the
  session loads it at startup, rebuilds it on every full scan, nudges it
  incrementally on apply/local-change, and persists it on the index throttle +
  at shutdown. `now_ns` is wall time used ONLY for the recency guard, never
  ordering (invariant #7). MEASUREMENT (synthetic 20k × ~256 B files, ignored
  test `scancache_speedup_measurement`): cold hash-all vs warm cache-hit —
  release 85.9 ms → 34.1 ms (2.5×), debug 161.0 ms → 98.5 ms (1.6×). The tiny
  files make readdir+stat dominate the warm scan; on real source trees (larger
  files) the hashing fraction — and thus the speedup — is larger, and the debug
  build's -O0 BLAKE3 (the scenario-12 startup-scan cost) is exactly what the
  cache elides. Unit tests: `scancache` decide/round-trip/version/corrupt, scan
  `cache_hit_reuses_hash_without_reading` / `recent_write_forces_hash_despite_cache_hit`
  / `stale_cache_entry_is_rehashed`.

- **Disk-full degradation (edge, scenario 21).** PRODUCT FIX: an inbound apply
  that hits `ENOSPC` (errno 28) is now NON-FATAL — the session stalls loudly
  instead of dying (invariant #5), and nothing partial is ever visible at a final
  path (invariant #8). Two failure points handled: (a) `write_chunk_file` (a big
  file's chunks stage to `.tomo/staging/chunks/` on the receiver — this is where
  a >1 MiB transfer fills the disk, BEFORE the engine absorbs the change) →
  abandon the assembly (freeing its partial chunks), so there is no phantom
  "present" head and nothing partial; (b) `write_present` (the final atomic
  write) → the atomic-write temp is cleaned up, so again nothing partial. Both
  set a `disk_stalled` flag + loud note. RECOVERY: while stalled, every
  `STALL_RETRY` (3 s) the session re-sends its `IndexExchange`; the peer's
  reconcile then reships every head we do not cover (the stalled file was never
  absorbed, so it is uncovered) — self-healing the instant space is freed, quiet
  once converged. `is_disk_full` (ENOSPC-only) is a unit-tested pure predicate.
  HONEST LIMIT: a *small inline* file (< 1 MiB) that ENOSPCs at `write_present`
  is post-absorb, so the retry's reship won't re-fetch it (the peer sees us
  covering it); it stalls without auto-recovery but never corrupts (no
  rescan-delete is scheduled). The realistic disk-full case is a large file
  (chunked, pre-absorb), which fully self-heals. Scenario 21 (`21_disk_full.sh`):
  B's project on a 24 MiB loopback tmpfs, filled to <8 MiB free; A pushes an
  8 MiB file (written atomically via `mv` so no 0-byte intermediate syncs) → B
  logs the stall, stays connected, A stays connected, NO partial at B's final
  path, `db check` green both; then the filler is deleted → B auto-re-requests
  and converges byte-for-byte. Skips cleanly without sudo; RUNS on this VM. 3×
  green via run-all.
